# Image Processing with Python
- This is just a college practice project where you can select and image and apply different image processing methods or algorithms and see the effect.
- Developed with **Python3.6**.
- Some of complex algorithms can be slow depending on your hardware as all of the algorithms are written in Python itself.
- Numpy array is used to hold the image pixel data during processing.
- Image is acquired from the specified directory with opencv.

## Set-Up
### Virtual Environment
You can use any of `venv`, `virtualenv`, `pyenv` etc. to create the virtual environment. Place the virtual environment wherever you want.
### Package Installations
In the virtual environment, check the version of `pip` and upgrade if required then install the packages with this command:
```
(venv)...$ pip install -r requirements.txt
```
## Run
Use this command to run the app:
```
(venv)...$ python GUI.py
```
Enjoy! :wink:
